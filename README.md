# JustWork
A mobile application for companies to post temporary/cover positions, and users to apply for them with minimal requirements.
# Description:
The application will be for companies that need temporary workers and for people who are looking for a one-time job. It will be similar to the Vikar services provided by Danish agencies. 
The idea is that companies post a job with a description, location, time, etc. Workers will be able to view those jobs and apply for them. Then the companies can accept someone’s application or reject it. Workers will have to be verified by a system, so that there would be no fake applications.
In short it will be a platform for all the current vikar agencies and other companies to post their jobs and also for users to see all the available jobs in one place and apply for them. 
The motivation behind this project is to be able to work on days you are free, with multiple companies instead of having the need to register with multiple vikar services and wait for a notification that there is a need for workers.
